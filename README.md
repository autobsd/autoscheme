# AutoScheme

AutoScheme is a practical cross-platform implementation of the Scheme programming language.  
It comprises a command-line application and an embeddable C library that provide the following:

- a Scheme interpreter
- an S2S compiler (Scheme to C/C++)
- an interactive REPL
- a command-line shell
- a set of modules that implement and extend the R7RS standard
